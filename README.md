# shopping-list-app
challenge
To complete this challenge requires:

Using DOM manipulation and traversal to dynamically add and remove HTML elements and apply styles.
Linking to an externally hosted library (jQuery) and an locally hosted JavaScript file (app.js).
Using this and event delegation
Requirements
In terms of user experience, your shopping list app must allow users to:

enter items they need to purchase by entering text and hitting "Return" or clicking the "Add item" button
check and uncheck items on the list by clicking the "Check" button
permanently remove items from the list
Additionally:

You must use a CDN-hosted version of jQuery
Put your application code in a file called app.js and link to it in index.html
Be sure to put both script elements at the bottom of the <body> element.
Do not alter index.html or main.css other than adding the links to the external JavaScript. Write JavaScript code that works with the existing HTML and CSS to implement the required features.
Hint: you may find it helpful to read up on and use the following jQuery methods: .submit(), preventDefault(), toggleClass(), and closest().
